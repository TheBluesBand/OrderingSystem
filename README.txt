# OrderingSystem
An example of a Ordering System for a Computer Part shop. 
Has some parts, checks for compatibilities, some super basic error checking.
A sample of some of my Java experience 

Compiling:
Nothing Prior to Java 8 should be used to compile this. Newer versions of
Java could be used but I cannot promise that it will work as I intended
